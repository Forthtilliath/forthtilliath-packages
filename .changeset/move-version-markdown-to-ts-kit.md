"@forthtilliath/ts-kit": minor
"@forthtilliath/expo-release-updates": patch
---

Moved `compareVersions` (new `version/` category) and `parseChangelogNotes` (new `markdown/` category) from `@forthtilliath/expo-release-updates` into `@forthtilliath/ts-kit` — both were 100% framework-agnostic. `expo-release-updates` now re-exports them from `ts-kit`, so its public API (root barrel and `@forthtilliath/expo-release-updates/compareVersions` / `.../parseChangelogNotes` deep imports) is unchanged.
