# @forthtilliath/react-native-kit

Small, dependency-free-of-app-theme React Native UI components, distributed one file per component so consumers only pull in what they use.

## Install

```bash
npm install @forthtilliath/react-native-kit react react-native
```

Or, from within this monorepo, as a workspace dependency:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@forthtilliath/react-native-kit": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

`react` and `react-native` are peer dependencies — install them in the consuming app if not already present.

## Usage

Each component is its own module — import the file you need directly:

```ts
import { ChangelogNotes } from "@forthtilliath/react-native-kit/ChangelogNotes";
```

### `<ChangelogNotes notes={...} styles={...} />`

Renders GitHub-style release notes — as produced by `@forthtilliath/expo-release-updates`'s `parseChangelogNotes` — as headings, bulleted items, and bold-aware text, instead of showing the raw Markdown syntax in a plain `Text`.

```tsx
<ChangelogNotes notes={release.notes} />
```

The component ships with neutral default styles and no opinion on your app's theme. Override any subset via the `styles` prop to match your colors/dark mode:

```tsx
<ChangelogNotes
  notes={release.notes}
  styles={{
    heading: { color: colors.text, fontWeight: "700" },
    itemText: { color: colors.textMuted },
  }}
/>
```

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm run dev            # tsc --watch -> dist/
pnpm run build          # tsc -> dist/
pnpm run check-types    # tsc --noEmit
pnpm run lint           # eslint
pnpm run test           # vitest run
pnpm run test:watch     # vitest
```

Built to `dist/` (see the `exports` field in `package.json`), so run `pnpm run build` (or `dev`) after source changes for consumers to see them.

### Testing note

`react-native`'s package entry uses Flow syntax that `@babel/parser`'s flow plugin can't parse (`as Cast` casts aren't supported there), so Vitest can never load the real package directly. Tests alias `react-native` to a minimal stub (`src/__mocks__/react-native.tsx`) instead — see that file for details.
